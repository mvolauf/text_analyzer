I prop+up[v] myself up on one elbow[n]. There's enough[adv] light[n] in

sunken 
faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. 
Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The 
reaping isn't until two. May as well sleep in. If you 
can. 

Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only 
have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field 
called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the 
woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high 
chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In 
theory, it's supposed to be electrified twenty-four 
hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live 
in the woods — packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, 
bears — that used to threaten our streets. But since 
we're lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in 
the evenings, it's usually safe to touch. Even so, I 
always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum 
that means the fence is live. Right now, it's silent as a 
stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out 
on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's 
been loose for years. There are several other weak 
spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I 
almost always enter the woods here. 

4 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



As soon as I'm in the trees, I retrieve a bow and 
sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, 
the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh- 
eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam 
freely, and there are added concerns like venomous 
snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. 
But there's also food if you know how to find it. My 
father knew and he taught me some before he was 
blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing 
even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still 
wake up screaming for him to run. 

Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and 
poaching carries the severest of penalties, more 
people would risk it if they had weapons. But most 
are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. 
My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a 
few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, 
carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father 
could have made good money selling them, but if the 
officials found out he would have been publicly 
executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the 
Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who 
hunt because they're as hungry for fresh meat as 
anybody is. In fact, they're among our best 
customers. But the idea that someone might be 
arming the Seam would never have been allowed. 

In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to 
harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. 
Always close enough to run back to the safety of 
District 12 if trouble arises. "District Twelve. Where 
you can starve to death in safety," I mutter. Then I 
glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in 
the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might 
overhear you. 

When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, 
the things I would blurt out about District 12, about 
5 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far- 
off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood 
this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned 
to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an 
indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my 
thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only 
polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little 
more than trades in the Hob, which is the black 
market where I make most of my money. Even at 
home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing 
tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or 
the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my 
words and then where would we be? 

In the woods waits the only person with whom I can 
be myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face 
relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to 
our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket 
of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The 
sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale 
says I never smile except in the woods. 

"Hey, Catnip," says Gale. My real name is Katniss, 
but when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. 
So he thought I'd said Catnip. Then when this crazy 
lynx started following me around the woods looking 
for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I 
finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off 
game. I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad 
company. But I got a decent price for his pelt. 

"Look what I shot," Gale holds up a loaf of bread with 
an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It's real bakery 
bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our 
grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the 
arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, 
inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood 
with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special 
occasions. 



6 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



"Mm, still warm," I say. He must have been at the 
bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. "What did 
it cost you?" 

"Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling 
sentimental this morning," says Gale. "Even wished 
me luck." 

"Well, we all feel a little closer today, don't we?" I say, 
not even bothering to roll my eyes. "Prim left us a 
cheese." I pull it out. 

His expression brightens at the treat. "Thank you, 
Prim. We'll have a real feast." Suddenly he falls into a 
Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the 
maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to 
read out the names at the leaping. "I almost forgot! 
Happy Hunger Games!" He plucks a few blackberries 
from the bushes around us. "And may the odds — " 
He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. 

I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin 
with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my 
tongue. " — be ever in your favor!" I finish with equal 
verve. We have to joke about it because the 
alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, 
the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything 
sounds funny in it. 

I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the 
bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, 
olive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But we're 
not related, at least not closely. Most of the families 
who work the mines resemble one another this way. 

That's why my mother and Prim, with their light hair 
and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My 
mother's parents were part of the small merchant 
class that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the 
7 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary 
shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no 
one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. 
My father got to know my mother because on his 
hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs 
and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. 
She must have really loved him to leave her home for 
the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is 
the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while 
her children turned to skin and bones. I try to forgive 
her for my father's sake. But to be honest, I'm not the 
forgiving type. 

Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat 
cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I 
strip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a 
nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible 
but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming 
with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish 
iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a 
blue sky and soft breeze. The food's wonderful, with 
the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the 
berries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be 
perfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off 
meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, 
hunting for tonight's supper. But instead we have to 
be standing in the square at two o'clock waiting for 
the names to be called out. 

"We could do it, you know," Gale says quietly. 

"What?" I ask. 

"Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You 
and I, we could make it," says Gale. 

I don't know how to respond. The idea is so 
preposterous. 



8 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



"If we didn't have so many kids," he adds quickly. 

They're not our kids, of course. But they might as well 
be. Gale's two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And 
you may as well throw in our mothers, too, because 
how would they live without us? Who would fill those 
mouths that are always asking for more? With both of 
us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has 
to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still 
nights when we go to bed with our stomachs 
growling. 

"I never want to have kids," I say. 

"I might. If I didn't live here," says Gale. 

"But you do," I say, irritated. 

"Forget it," he snaps back. 

The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I 
leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I'm 
certain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We 
can't leave, so why bother talking about it? And even 
if we did . . . even if we did . . . where did this stuff 
about having kids come from? There's never been 
anything romantic between Gale and me. When we 
met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he 
was only two years older, he already looked like a 
man. It took a long time for us to even become 
friends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin 
helping each other out. 

Besides, if he wants kids, Gale won't have any trouble 
finding a wife. He's good-looking, he's strong enough 
to handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. 
You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him 
when he walks by in school that they want him. It 



9 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



makes me jealous but not for the reason people would 
think. Good hunting partners are hard to find. 

"What do you want to do?" I ask. We can hunt, fish, 
or gather. 

"Let's fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and 
gather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight," 
he says. 

Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to 
celebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that 
their children have been spared for another year. But 
at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their 
doors, and try to figure out how they will survive the 
painful weeks to come. 

We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day 
when easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, 
we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, 
a gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years 
ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around 
it to keep out the animals. 

On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black 
market that operates in an abandoned warehouse 
that once held coal. When they came up with a more 
efficient system that transported the coal directly 
from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took 
over the space. Most businesses are closed by this 
time on reaping day, but the black market's still fairly 
busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, 
the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old 
woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large 
kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in 
exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might 
do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to 
keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She's the only 
one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild 
10 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



dog. We don't hunt them on purpose, but if you're 
attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is 
meat. "Once it's in the soup, 111 call it beef," Greasy 
Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn 
up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the 
Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a 
little choosier. 

When we finish our business at the market, we go to 
the back door of the mayor's house to sell half the 
strawberries, knowing he has a particular fondness 
for them and can afford our price. The mayor's 
daughter, Madge, opens the door. She's in my year at 
school. Being the mayor's daughter, you'd expect her 
to be a snob, but she's all right. She just keeps to 
herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a 
group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at 
school. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at 
assemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely 
talk, which suits us both just fine. 

Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an 
expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up 
with a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. 

"Pretty dress," says Gale. 

Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if it's a 
genuine compliment or if he's just being ironic. Itisa 
pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it 
ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then 
smiles. "Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want 
to look nice, don't I?" 

Now it's Gale's turn to be confused. Does she mean 
it? Or is she messing with him? I'm guessing the 
second. 



11 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



"You won't be going to the Capitol," says Gale coolly. 
His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her 
dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a 
family in bread for months. "What can you have? Five 
entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old." 

"That's not her fault," I say. 

"No, it's no one's fault. Just the way it is," says Gale. 
Madge's face has become closed off. She puts the 
money for the berries in my hand. "Good luck, 
Katniss." "You, too," I say, and the door closes. 

We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don't like that 
Gale took a dig at Madge, but he's right, of course. 
The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting 
the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the 
day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered 
once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until 
you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of 
eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven 
times. That's true for every citizen in all twelve 
districts in the entire country of Panem. 

But here's the catch. Say you are poor and starving 
as we were. You can opt to add your name more times 
in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a 
meager year's supply of grain and oil for one person. 
You may do this for each of your family members as 
well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered 
four times. Once, because I had to, and three times 
for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my 
mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. 
And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of 
sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. 
Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or 
single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven 
years, will have his name in forty-two times. 



12 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



You can see why someone like Madge, who has never 
been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The 
chance of her name being drawn is very slim 
compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not 
impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were 
set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not 
Madge's family, it's hard not to resent those who don't 
have to sign up for tesserae. 

Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On 
other days, deep in the woods, I've listened to him 
rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to 
cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred 
between the starving workers of the Seam and those 
who can generally count on supper and thereby 
ensure we will never trust one another. "It's to the 
Capitol's advantage to have us divided among 
ourselves," he might say if there were no ears to hear 
but mine. If it wasn't reaping day. If a girl with a gold 
pin and no tesserae had not made what I'm sure she 
thought was a harmless comment. 

As we walk, I glance over at Gale's face, still 
smoldering underneath his stony expression. His 
rages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. 
It's not that I don't agree with him. I do. But what 
good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the 
woods? It doesn't change anything. It doesn't make 
things fair. It doesn't fill our stomachs. In fact, it 
scares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. 
Better he does it in the woods than in the district. 

Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple 
of loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of 
strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for 
each. 

"See you in the square," I say. 



13 | P a g e 



The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



"Wear something pretty," he says flatly. 



At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. 
My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary 
days. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and 
ruffled blouse. It's a bit big on her, but my mother 
has made it stay with pins. Even so, she's having 
trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. 

A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt 
and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To 
my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own 
lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching 
shoes. 

"Are you sure?" I ask. I'm trying to get past rejecting 
offers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I 
wouldn't allow her to do anything for me. And this is 
something special. Her clothes from her past are very 
precious to her. 

"Of course. Let's put your hair up, too," she says. I let 
her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can 
hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that 
leans against the wall. 

"You look beautiful," says Prim in a hushed voice. 

"And nothing like myself," I say. I hug her, because I 
know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her 
first reaping. She's about as safe as you can get, since 
she's only entered once. I wouldn't let her take out 
any tesserae. But she's worried about me. That the 
unthinkable might happen. 

I protect Prim in every way I can, but I'm powerless 
against the reaping. The anguish I always feel when 
she's in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to 
register on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out 
14 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay 
calm. "Tuck your tail in, little duck," I say, smoothing 
the blouse back in place. 

Prim giggles and gives me a small"Quack." 

"Quack yourself," I say with a light laugh. The kind 
only Prim can draw out of me. "Come on, let's eat," I 
say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. 

The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but 
that will be for supper. We decide to save the 
strawberries and bakery bread for this evening's meal, 
to make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from 
Prim's goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from 
the tessera grain, although no one has much appetite 
anyway. 

At one o'clock, we head for the square. Attendance is 
mandatory unless you are on death's door. This 
evening, officials will come around and check to see if 
this is the case. If not, youll be imprisoned. 

It's too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the 
square — one of the few places in District 12 that can 
be pleasant. The square's surrounded by shops, and 
on public market days, especially if there's good 
weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite 
the bright banners hanging on the buildings, there's 
an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like 
buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. 

People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a 
good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the 
population as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year- 
olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, 
the oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, 
toward the back. Family members line up around the 
perimeter, holding tightly to one another's hands. But 
15 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins 



there are others, too, who have no one they love at 
stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the 
crowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will 
be drawn. Odds are given on their ages, whether 
they're Seam or merchant, if they will break down and 
weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but 
carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be 
informers, and who hasn't broken the law? I could be 
shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of 
those in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim 
the same. 

Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose 
between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the 
bullet would be much quicker. 

The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people 
arrive. The square's quite large, but not enough to 
hold District 12's population of about eight thousand. 
Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where 
they can watch the event on screens as it's televised 
live by the state. 

I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the 
Seam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our 
attention on the temporary stage that is set up before 
the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, 
and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for 
the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls' ball. 
Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on 
them in careful handwriting. 

Two of the three chairs fill with Madge's father, Mayor 
Undersee, who's a tall, balding man, and Effie 
Trinket, District 12's escort, fresh from the Capitol 
with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring 
green suit. They murmur to each other and then look 
with concern at the empty seat.

Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps 
up to the podium and begins to read. It's the same 
story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the 
country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that 
was once called North America. He lists the disasters, 
the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching 
seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the 
brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The 
result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by 
thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity 
to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising 
of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were 
defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of 
Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace 
and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must 
never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. 

The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In 
punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve 
districts must provide one girl and one boy, called 
tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will 
be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold 
anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. 
Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must 
fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. 

Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill 
one another while we watch — this is the Capitol's 
way of reminding us how totally we are at their 
mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving 
another rebellion. 

Whatever words they use, the real message is 
clear. "Look how we take your children and sacrifice 
them and there's nothing you can do. If you lift a 
finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as 
we did in District Thirteen."

To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the 
Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a 
festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against 
the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease 
back home, and their district will be showered with 
prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol 
will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil 
and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us 
battle starvation. 

"It is both a time for repentance and a time for 
thanks," intones the mayor. 

Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In 
seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one 
is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle- 
aged man, who at this moment appears hollering 
something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and 
falls into the third chair. He's drunk. Very. The crowd 
responds with its token applause, but he's confused 
and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she 
barely manages to fend off.
